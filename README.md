# Neural_Network_Image_Classification-
The code includes an example of convolutional neural network image classification model. The data was above the maximum limit of github so it could not be uploaded.
However the data can be any two files with different types of images in terms of context, e.g. dogs-cats, cars-trucks, buildings-forest etc. The model is trained by using around 450 images in total.
